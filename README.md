And that's it! Download the notebook, and you can start creating feature-level adversaries in <10 minutes. We recommend using Google Colab with a GPU runtime. Note that these attacks are trained to optimize a complex objective and can have variable success, so always run multiple trials. 

We hope you find studying feature-level adversaries to be as insightful and fun as we do! Please email us with any questions.
